/**
 * @file
 *
 * nvgpu_worker is a fifo based produce-consumer worker for the
 * nvgpu driver. Its meant to provide a generic implementation with hooks
 * to allow each application to implement specific use cases for producing
 * and consuming the work. The user of this API enqueues new work and awakens
 * the worker thread. On being awakened, the worker thread checks for pending
 * work or a user provided terminating condition. The generic poll
 * implementation also provides for early terminating conditions as well as
 * pre and post processing hooks. Below is the generic interface of
 * nvgpu_worker consume function.
 *
 * static int nvgpu_worker_poll_work(void *arg)
 * {
 * 	struct nvgpu_worker *worker = (struct nvgpu_worker *)arg;
 * 	int get = 0;
